So, my 4th grader got this homework assignment:

Use the clues to find the mystery 5-digit number
* All the digits are different
* The Thousands digit is 7 more than the Tens digit
* The Hundreds digit is the sum of the Thousands digit and the Ones digit
* The total of the digits added together is 24

I'm a reasonably educated fully grown man but I could not figure out a way to solve this problem, aside from brute forcing thousands of combinations.

But, I know how to code so that's what I did.

Here is the solution
